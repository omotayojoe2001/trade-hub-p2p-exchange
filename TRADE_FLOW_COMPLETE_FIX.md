# 🔧 Complete Trade Flow Fix ✅

## 🐛 **Issues Fixed:**

### **1. ✅ Mock Data (MERCYPAY) Removed**
**Before:** Payment Status showed "MercyPay" regardless of selected merchant
**After:** Shows actual selected merchant name

### **2. ✅ Trade Request Timing Fixed**
**Before:** Trade request sent immediately when selecting merchant
**After:** Trade request sent only when user enters amount and clicks "Send Trade Request"

### **3. ✅ Duplicate Trade Requests Eliminated**
**Before:** Multiple trade requests created for same action
**After:** ONE trade request per user action

### **4. ✅ Real Amount Collection**
**Before:** Used hardcoded amounts, ignored user input
**After:** Uses actual amount entered by user on Payment Status

## 🔄 **FIXED TRADE FLOW:**

### **Before (Broken):**
```
1. Customer: Select merchant → Creates trade request immediately
2. Payment Status: Shows "MercyPay" (mock data)
3. Multiple duplicate requests sent
4. Wrong amounts and rates
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```
1. Customer: Buy Crypto → Enter amount → Merchant List
2. Customer: Select merchant → Payment Status (shows REAL merchant)
3. Customer: Enter final amount → Click "Send Trade Request"
4. Merchant: Gets ONE notification with correct amount
5. Merchant: Accept/Reject → Real-time response
```

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE TESTING:**

### **Step 1: Run Database Cleanup**
```bash
# Clean up duplicate trade requests
node scripts/test-fixed-trade-flow.js

5. **✅ Payment Status should show REAL merchant name** (not MercyPay)

#### **🏪 Merchant (User A) Flow:**
1. **Should get ONE notification** for specific amount
2. **Click "Requests"** → Should see trade with correct details
