# 🔧 Trade Request Flow Fixes ✅

## 🐛 **Issues Fixed:**

### **1. ✅ Wrong Navigation Flow**
**Before:** BuyCrypto → BuyCryptoMatch → PaymentStatus (mock data)
**After:** BuyCrypto → MerchantList → PaymentStatus (real data)

### **2. ✅ Duplicate Trade Requests**
**Issue:** Same trade request appearing 5+ times
**Fix:** Database cleanup script removes duplicates

### **3. ✅ Wrong Coin Types & Rates**
**Issue:** Showing BNB instead of BTC, ₦5 rate instead of proper rates
**Fix:** Use real data from buy crypto form

### **4. ✅ 403 Accept Trade Error**
**Issue:** Merchants can't accept trades due to RLS policies
**Fix:** Updated RLS policies to allow merchant acceptance

### **5. ✅ Missing Amount Collection**
**Issue:** Not using user-entered amounts
**Fix:** Pass real amounts from BuyCrypto to MerchantList
