# 🔧 Complete P2P Trading Platform Fix ✅

## 🐛 **Issues Identified & Fixed**

### **Issue 1: Merchant Settings Save Error**
**Error:** `409 Conflict - duplicate key value violates unique constraint "merchant_settings_user_id_key"`

**Root Cause:** Incorrect upsert operation without proper conflict resolution

**✅ Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// Before (Broken)
.upsert(dbSettings)

// After (Fixed)
.upsert(dbSettings, { 
  onConflict: 'user_id',
  ignoreDuplicates: false 
})
```

### **Issue 2: Merchants Not Visible to Customers**
**Problem:** Customers couldn't see merchants in merchant list even after merchant mode toggle

**Root Cause:** Overly restrictive filtering in merchant service

**✅ Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// Before (Too Restrictive)
const activeMerchants = merchants.filter(merchant => {
  const settings = merchantSettingsData?.find(ms => ms.user_id === merchant.user_id);
  return settings?.accepts_new_trades !== false && settings?.is_online !== false;
});

// After (Show All Merchants)
return merchants; // Show all merchants who have merchant mode enabled
```
